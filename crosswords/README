Crosswords

For this quiz let’s tackle a classic problem. I’ve seen it just about every-
where in some form or another, but I believe Donald E. Knuth may have
first made it a popular challenge.
The quiz is to lay out crossword puzzles. A puzzle layout will be pro-
vided in a file, with the file name passed as a command-line argument.

The layout will be formatted as such:

X _ _ _ _ X X
_ _ X _ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ X _ _
_ X _ _ X X X
_ _ _ X _ _ _
X _ _ _ _ _ X

X s denote filled-in squares, and underscores are where a puzzle worker
would enter letters. Each row of the puzzle is on a new line. The spaces
are a readability tool and should be ignored by your program.
